# GEO1001-hw1
Assigment 1 for TU Delft GEO1001 Sensing Technologies and Mathematics for Geomatics.

## Whats the assigment?
For this assignment you will use data collected from 5 heat stress sensors placed somewhere in the Netherlands during this summer. The sensors are Kestrel 5400 and their specs are included within the assignment materials. In order to identify if the dataset is of any value to your “employer”, it is your job to deeply analyse the dataset and derive hypothesis from it.

## How to run?
* ```python geo1001_hw01.py```
* or open .ipynb files for each part
