\section*{Introduction}
For this assignment we used the data-set containing climate data measured in 5 locations within the town of Rijsenhout \citep{data}. The report is roughly subdivided into five sections related to each independent lesson (i.e. A1-4 + Bonus), with each section further split into a subsection for each corresponding question.

\section{A1}

\subsection{Mean statistics}
\textit{
Compute mean statistics (mean, variance and standard deviation for each of the sensors variables), what do you observe from the results?
}\\

Answer.

\subsection{Temperature histograms}
\textit{
Create 1 plot that contains histograms for the 5 sensors Temperature values. Compare histograms with 5 and 50 bins, why is the number of bins important?
}\\

See Figure ~\ref{fig:1-2}.

\label{fig:1-2}
\end{figure}


\newpage

\subsection{Temperature frequency polygons}
\textit{
Create 1 plot where frequency polygons for the 5 sensors Temperature values overlap in different colors with a legend.
}\\

See Figure ~\ref{fig:1-3}.

\label{fig:1-3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Boxplots}
\textit{
Generate 3 plots that include the 5 sensors boxplot for: Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Temperature.
}\\

See Figure ~\ref{fig:1-4}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1-4-box.png}
\caption{Boxplots of Wind Speed, Direction and Temperature}
\label{fig:1-4}
\end{figure}

\section{A2}

\subsection{Temperature distribution}
\textit{
Plot PMF, PDF and CDF for the 5 sensors Temperature values. Describe the behaviour of the distributions, are they all similar?
What about their tails?
}\\

See Figure ~\ref{fig:2-1}. The temperature measurement distributions are all fairly similar and could be all described as asymmetrical positively-skewed distributions. They roughly resemble normal distributions, although some anomalies in the tails can be observed.

\label{fig:2-1}
\end{figure}


\newpage

\section{A3}

\subsection{Correlation scatter-plot}
\textit{
Compute the correlations between all the sensors for the variables: Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Crosswind Speed. Perform correlation between sensors with the same variable, not between two different variables; for example, correlate Temperature time series between sensor A and B. Use Pearson’s and Spearmann’s rank coefficients. Make a scatter plot with both coefficients with the 3 variables.
}\\


See Figure ~\ref{fig:3-1}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3-1-scatter.png}
\caption{Pearson (and Spearman) correlation ranks between all sensors measurements of Temperature(Te), Crosswind Speed(Cr) and WBGT(WB)}
\label{fig:3-1}
\end{figure}


\newpage

\subsection{Correlation conclusion}
\textit{
What can you say about the sensors’ correlations?
}\\

We observe very strong (\(r>0.9\)) correlations in Temperature and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature measurements in between all sensors.
The correlations between Crosswind Speed measurements are weak or moderate (\(0.4<r<0.6\)).
% That is however to be expected, since compered to the measured wind-speed, which may differ greatly with small differences in sensor placement, temperature is a much more of a macro-scale phenomena.


\subsection{Location hypothesis}
\textit{
If we told you that that the sensors are located as follows (Figure~\ref{fig:3-3}), hypothesize which location would you assign to each sensor and reason your hypothesis using the correlations.
}\\

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, trim={4cm 6cm 4cm 6cm}, clip]{3-3-map.png}
\caption{Situation map of the five sensors}
\label{fig:3-3}
\end{figure}

Two pairs on sensors have been each situated in close proximity to each other, or in very similar conditions. One sensor has been placed in a separate location. According to our hypothesis we should identify the two pairs by their stronger correlations and the one 'outlier' sensor by its weaker correlation to the rest of the group.
\\
\\The two mutually exclusive pairs with strongest correlations are:
\\ \quad Sensor C, D   \quad   \emph{Crosswind speed 0.563,   Temperature 0.989,   WBGT 0.992}
\\ \quad Sensor A, B   \quad   \emph{Crosswind speed 0.550,   Temperature 0.987,   WBGT 0.991}
\\
\\The remaining sensor E consistently has the lowest correlation with the rest of the sensors:
\\ \quad Sensor E, x   \quad   \emph{Crosswind speed \textless0.473,   Temperature \textless0.972,   WBGT \textless0.954}

\section{A4}

\subsection{CDF and confidence intervals}
\textit{
Plot the CDF for all the sensors and for variables Temperature and Wind Speed, then compute the 95\% confidence intervals for variables Temperature and Wind Speed for all the sensors and save them in a table (txt or csv form).
}\\

See Figure~\ref{fig:4-1} and Table~\ref{tab:1}

\caption{Cumulative distribution functions of Temperature and Wind Speed}
\label{fig:4-1}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\label{tab:1}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
            & Sensor A      & Sensor B      & Sensor C      & Sensor D      & Sensor E      \\
Temperature & 17.81 - 18.13 & 17.90 - 18.23 & 17.75 - 18.07 & 17.84 - 18.15 & 18.18 - 18.53 \\
Wind Speed  & 1.25 - 1.33   & 1.20 - 1.29   & 1.32 - 1.42   & 1.53 - 1.63   & 0.57 - 0.62  
\end{tabular}
\caption{Temperature and Wind Speed 95\% confidence intervals}
\end{table}


\subsection{Similarity hypothesis}
\textit{
Test the hypothesis: the time series for Temperature and Wind Speed are the same for sensors:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1) E, D
\item 2) D, C
\item 3) C, B
\item 4) B, A
\end{itemize}
